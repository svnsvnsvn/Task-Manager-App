# Task Manager App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the App
This is a simple Task Manager application built with React to provide a hands-on introduction to React components, state, and props. With this app, users can:
* Add Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task."
* View Tasks: See a list of all tasks.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.

The app demonstrates the use of React features such as functional components, state management with hooks, and props for data flow.

## Steps to Run the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the app.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
